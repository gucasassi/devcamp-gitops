# GitOps for K8s (ArgoCD & Kustomize) 🚀

The definitive repository containing all Kubernetes deployment manifests for the DevCamp application. It strictly adheres to GitOps principles, using **Kustomize** Overlays to manage configuration drift across three distinct environments: **Develop**, **Preview**, and **Production**. This repository serves as the single source of truth continuously synchronized by **ArgoCD** on the cluster.
